 * Explanation:@JochemKuijpers this particular signature is required, because SDL alters default program entry point resolving.
 * In normal circumstances, you can use one of many standard signatures for the main function, int main(),
 * void main(), int main (int, char**), etc. The compiler will accept all these variants.
 * But SDL intercepts the main entry point, as described in my answer,
 * and calls your entry point expecting a specific signature, which is no longer subject to compiler interpretation.
