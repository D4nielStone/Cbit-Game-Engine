// Notes int argv, char** args this line is actully important and I dont know why?
// answer get from : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10803918/undefined-reference-to-sdl-main
// Explaination:
//@JochemKuijpers this particular signature is required, because SDL alters default program entry point resolving.
// In normal circumstances, you can use one of many standard signatures for the main function, int main(),
// void main(), int main(int, char**), etc. The compiler will accept all these variants.
// But SDL intercepts the main entry point, as described in my answer,
// and calls your entry point expecting a specific signature, which is no longer subject to compiler interpretation.
